# What I would do with more time
I struggled to find time in my week to work on the test. I have tried to include bits of my different abilities whilst having to cut some of the requirements short.

## Testing
I have included some unit tests but I would add more unit tests. If I had more time I would also add Cypress to the project. It doesn't need it with the scope of the project but I wanted to showcase that I can use Cypress.

I would also add tests for the dummy api and I would get my test coverage up to 100%. 

## Styling
In my time frame, I managed roughly half of the styling. It's not much but I wanted to see a little bit of responsive styling. It's not matching the Figma document but I focused on functionality over style in this test. If I had more time, I would spend time making it pixel perfect. The bits I did style I made as pixel perfect to the designs expect from the font match.

## Logic
I believe I have covered all of the specified logic
